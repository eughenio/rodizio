# Rodizio
It's a tool to help you to know if you are inside the Rodízio area in São Paulo.

Special thanks to Alexandre Fugita, http://meiobit.com/10720/google-maps-personalizado/, by the KMZ that he did.

Very special thanks to JetBrains, https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/, they gave to me a PHPStorm license, so, each improvement of this project is because they turned my work easiest with this amazing tool.
