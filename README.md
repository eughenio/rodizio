# Rodizio
It's a tool to help you to know if you are inside the Rodízio area in São Paulo - Brazil.

## How it works
Rodizio is a traffic restriction program made by the city hall to reduce the traffic in São paulo - Brazil

Over the map is shown the Rodizio area.

Depending the final number of your car plate, you can't drive between 7AM and 10AM and between 17PM and 20PM in the weekdays:

- 1 or 2 = Monday
- 3 or 4 = Tuesday
- 5 or 6 = Wednesday
- 7 or 8 = Thursday
- 9 or 10 = Friday

On Weekends there's no Rodizio.
